category: Research

Copy and paste your bibliography to see how gender-bias or gender-balanced it is!

**NOTE**

  - The tool currently only works with peer-reviewed and indexed papers. Including books, reports, and theses may produce an error. It is advisable to remove them before pasting the text in the box below. 
  - The tool will always provide an output - the most likely match. Most matches are correct, but some noise if to be expected (especially for older or lesser-known articles)
  - Allow some time for the tool to retrieve the information from the API (up to a couple of minutes for long bibliographies).

**PLEASE** 

This tool relies on the kindness of the [Crossref API](https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc). Don't abuse it!
