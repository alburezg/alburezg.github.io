#  Working papers

I am currently interested in the effects of mass violence exercised against non-combatants. I use a mix-methods research design to analyse how reproductive behaviour changes after genocidal violence, in particular the role of pronatalism in post-war settings. I am also interested in the ‘protective’ effects of family during and after armed conflicts. My research uses respondent-generated genealogical data to study population dynamics during and after mortality crises.
