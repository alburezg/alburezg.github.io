# MS Office in K'iche'

In 2012-2013 we localised more than half a million technical terms to K'iche' Mayan for the first **Microsoft Office Language Interface Pack 2013 â€“ K'iche'**. Work was done with the amazing folks at [MTT](https://www.facebook.com/Mayan-Technological-Translations-411483082247666/). *Tyox chiwe!* Here you can download most of the neologisms that we created for the K'iche' Language pack.

# Facebook in K'iche'

Ckiky Guarchaj prepared an [amazing tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_SWC0lXreI) on installing Facebook in K'iche' (in Spanish). You can also get the full list and morphology of the neologisms that we created for the translation of Facebook.
