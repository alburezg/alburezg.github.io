# About me

PhD candidate in Demography/Population Studies at the London School of Economics. My background is in anthropology and social research methodology. Currently interested in forced migration and displaced populations. My research uses offline and online data, social network analysis, and mixed-methods designs. You will probably find me coding in #RStats. I am on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=uyx520sAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&gmla=AJsN-F5Qqb0hd3B0qivi8Hgo906iqIDsIV4_AoQ_AXo4d7tK9JWn3vD5Uh_DdsT3nJNg_fWgYuma6tRQ83kVBljTd346Abk1aRJ77fnNsqC1GPM4jlU03Pc), [ORCID](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9823-5179), and [the LSE website](http://www.lse.ac.uk/social-policy/people/research-students/Diego-Alburez-Gutiérrez).
