# About me

Hi! I am a Research Scientist at the [Laboratory of Digital and Computational Demography](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/laboratories/digital_and_computational_demography_5555/default.htm) of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (MPIDR). My background is in anthropology, demography, and social research methodology. Currently interested in combining digital and 'traditional' data to study intergenerational demographic processes. My research uses offline and online data, social network analysis, and mixed-methods designs. You will probably find me coding in #RStats. I am on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=uyx520sAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&gmla=AJsN-F5Qqb0hd3B0qivi8Hgo906iqIDsIV4_AoQ_AXo4d7tK9JWn3vD5Uh_DdsT3nJNg_fWgYuma6tRQ83kVBljTd346Abk1aRJ77fnNsqC1GPM4jlU03Pc) and [ORCID](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9823-5179).
