# About me

Hi! I am a Research Scientist and Research Area Chair (Aging and Generational Processes) at the [Laboratory of Digital and Computational Demography](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/laboratories/digital_and_computational_demography_5555/default.htm) of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (MPIDR). 
I do basic demography with a particular focus on kinship processes in an inter-generational perspective. 
My research focuses on how changing demographic regimes affect, among other things, the exposure to mortality and availability of family resources over the life-course of people. 
For this, I combine mathematical modeling, micro-simulation techniques, and empirical data from genealogical sources.


I am mainly motivated by the persisting demographic inequalities between the Global North and South and within particular countries. 
My PhD thesis focused on an extreme case: the [demographic consequences of genocide](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol40/23/) for an indigenous population in Guatemala. 
My later work has expanded this line of work to highlight how the experience of life events, such as the death of an offspring, vary around the world and how this will change in the future.
